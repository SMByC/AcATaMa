about=AcATaMa is a powerful and complete Qgis plugin for accuracy assessment. It provides comprehensive support for sampling, response design and estimation within a design-based inference framework. The primary goal of AcATaMa is to equip users with the necessary tools to comply with international guidance and best practices for sampling design, estimation of land category areas and changes, and map accuracy assessment. The plugin supports accuracy assessment for any thematic map across diverse use cases. A common application is in remote sensing, particularly for land use and land cover classification, environmental monitoring, urban planning, forestry, agriculture, and more. However, AcATaMa is not limited to these applications; some modules, such as sampling and labeling, can be used independently for other user cases.

changelog=
    25.7:
    - Add user-customized keyboard shortcuts for labeling buttons using a shortcut configuration dialog in the labeling buttons setup, #27
    - Add keyboard shortcuts for navigating samples and zooming in/out in the response design window, part of #27
    - New systematic sampling process that uses pixels as a unit of measurement in its systematic sampling methodology
    - The systematic sampling process has been significantly improved, resulting in increased speed, more robust statistical methodology and procedures.
    - Refactor file dialog to use a new utility function for saving files, fixing an issue where the user did not configure the extension or if that extension was incorrect or invalid
    - Ensure inclusion of right-bottom borders in systematic sampling offset area by distance or pixels
    - Convert label to integer for auto fill labeling buttons from thematic map
    - Fix a bug that Acatama handle 0 as nodata even when thematic file uses zero for a valid class, bug reported thanks to @Josi-Nic, #26
    - Improving the suggested filename for the sampling file
    - Use manual random seed only if the random sampling options block is enabled
    - Include the saved configuration file path in message
    - Catch all exceptions when reading the AcATaMa configuration file
    - Fix an error message due to a incorrect band when the thematic layer is changed, forcing band list population in post-stratification section
    - Fix a bug in the offset grid calculation in systematic random sampling by pixels
    - Fix file extension validation to correctly parse valid extensions from filter string
    - Change the default YAML filename extension in the AcATaMa configuration file to .yaml
    - Enhance systematic random sampling documentation by the new two systematic techniques by distance and by pixels
    - Fix text and tooltips for pixel units methodology in systematic sampling
    - Validate pixel centroid before sampling to ensure valid coordinates
    - Add tests for accuracy assessment using zero as a class to sampling and outside thematic map coverage
    - Enforce the conversion of decimal percentage stored in the yaml file in the case when a locale considers the comma as a decimal separator
    - Add systematic sampling tests by pixels with different configurations
    - Handle locale initialization to fix some issues for some user edge cases loading the plugin
    - Updated the tests based on the new systematic sampling method
    - Fix tooltip texts and warnings messages
