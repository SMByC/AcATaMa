about=AcATaMa is a powerful and complete Qgis plugin for accuracy assessment designed for land use/land cover classification, including supervised/unsupervised classification or any thematic map. It provides comprehensive support for sampling, response design and estimation within a design-based inference framework. The primary goal of AcATaMa is to equip users with the necessary tools to comply with international guidance and best practices for sampling design, estimation of land category areas and changes, and map accuracy assessment.

changelog=
    23.4:
    - Added a new mechanism to compute in parallel the counting of the unique pixel values (thematic classes)
      required for stratified sampling design and analysis using area based proportion.
    - Added the option for systematic sampling to set the initial inset from left-top corner using a random value.
    - Added the external library Dask in the plugin to allow parallel computing in some processes.
    - Added all the tests to verify and check the accuracy assessment results in the different sampling types.
    - Fixed an issue for the standard deviation in the overall accuracy for the post-stratify estimators
    - Fixed the slot event for load the file and select the layer in the ComboBox for Qgis layers
    - Adjusted all the exercises with the all configurations of the plugin and added the missing ones.
    - All commits in: https://github.com/SMByC/AcATaMa/commits
