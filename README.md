AcATaMa is a powerful and complete Qgis plugin for accuracy assessment. It provides comprehensive support for sampling,
response design and estimation within a design-based inference framework. The primary goal of AcATaMa is to equip users
with the necessary tools to comply with international guidance and best practices for sampling design, estimation of
land category areas and changes, and map accuracy assessment.

The plugin supports accuracy assessment for any thematic map across diverse use cases. A common application is in
remote sensing, particularly for land use and land cover classification, environmental monitoring, urban planning,
forestry, agriculture, and more. However, AcATaMa is not limited to these applications; some modules, such as sampling
and labeling, can be used independently for other user cases.

To ensure a good accuracy assessment AcATaMa provides three components: **sampling design**, used to select the
reference sample; the **response design**, which allows the evaluation protocol, and finally, the **analysis**
procedures with different estimators:
