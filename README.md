AcATaMa is a powerful and complete Qgis plugin for accuracy assessment designed for land use/land cover classification,
including supervised/unsupervised classification or any thematic map. It provides comprehensive support for sampling,
response design and estimation within a design-based inference framework. The primary goal of AcATaMa is to equip users
with the necessary tools to comply with international guidance and best practices for sampling design, estimation of
land category areas and changes, and map accuracy assessment.

To ensure a good accuracy assessment AcATaMa provides three components: **sampling design**, used to select the
reference sample; the **response design**, which allows the evaluation protocol, and finally, the **analysis** 
procedures with different estimators. AcATaMa has been manually tested with multiple real examples for all user 
cases in order to guarantee the quality of the results.
