# AcATaMa

AcATaMa (sort for Accuracy Assessment of Thematic Maps) is a Qgis plugin that provides comprehensive support for sampling, 
response design and estimation in a design-based inference framework. The primary goal of AcATaMa is to provide users with 
the necessary tools to comply with international guidance and best practices for sampling design, estimating land category 
areas and land change, and for assessing map accuracy.

AcATaMa provides several sampling designs and estimators, but also comprehensive support for the response design process 
(see response design). AcATaMa has been manually tested with multiple real examples for all user cases in order to 
guarantee the quality of the results, some of them have been implemented as 
[unit tests](https://github.com/SMByC/AcATaMa/actions/workflows/tests.yml).

AcATaMa implements equations, methodologies and recommendations from (primarily) the following widely accepted papers, 
and we recommend reading as theoretical support and delving into the guide, protocol and recommendations for the entire 
process to calculate the accuracy assessment of a map, and how AcATaMa works:
