# Analysis

The main objective of the accuracy evaluation is the estimation of the area. It seeks to ensure that each land cover 
class is correctly classified, as well as the confidence intervals of the accuracy measurements for said cover classes. 
For this, the analysis component should focus on organizing and summarizing information to quantify accuracy. And later, 
estimate the accuracy and the area, from the sample data.

The confusion matrix is the most widely used method for assessing accuracy. The matrix should remain a cornerstone of 
the analysis protocol due to its ease of interpretation and valuable descriptive information. Typically, the map data 
is arranged in rows and the reference data is arranged in columns in the matrix. The values arranged on the diagonal of 
the confusion matrix indicate the degree of agreement between the two data sets.

This matrix is essential for the analysis of the area and variance estimators. The row and column totals of the 
population error matrix are important because they quantify the distribution, by area, of different land cover classes. 
The row totals represent the proportion of area of each class, according to the map classification. On the other hand, 
the totals of the columns represent the proportion of area, according to the reference classification. Accuracy 
assessment focuses on three types of analysis and parameters. The first at a global level, defined as general accuracy 
or Kappa coefficient. The second that focuses on the specific accuracy of the class and is classified as the accuracy 
of the user or the producer. And, the third, which corresponds to the estimation of the proportion of area by a class.

a class. In practice, the analysis should focus on easily interpretable accuracy measures, and thus the error matrix 
should reflect the area proportional representation of the study region. The main requirements for the analysis to 
satisfy the criterion of statistical rigor involve using consistent estimators and quantifying the variability of the 
accuracy and area estimates, using standard errors or confidence intervals.
