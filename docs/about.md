# About Us

AcATaMa is developed and maintained by the Forest and Carbon Monitoring System (SMByC) at the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM) in Colombia. SMByC is responsible for measuring and ensuring the accuracy of the official national forest figures in Colombia, as well as activity data related to forest cover change for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reporting in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

As part of the SMByC, we identified the need to not only establish a systematic and rigorous approach, but also to streamline and optimize the accuracy assessment procedure. To address this gap, we developed AcATaMa as an open-source QGIS plugin specifically designed for the accuracy assessment of thematic raster maps. AcATaMa is an official component of our Digital Image Processing Protocol for Quantifying Deforestation in Colombia {cite}`Galindo2014`, where it plays a central role in our accuracy assessment workflows. We use AcATaMa to conduct systematic evaluations of thematic maps, ensuring that our forest monitoring products meet the accuracy standards required for national reporting.
