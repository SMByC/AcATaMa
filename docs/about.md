# About

The AcATaMa plugin was designed mainly with these keys goals:

1. To assess the accuracy of thematic maps
2. To estimate areas of the map classes (for example land cover and land change), according to Olofsson et al. (2013, 2014).
3. Sampling design/classification

But nevertheless, you can use AcATaMa for many different uses (you can see some examples in [use cases](use_cases.md))).

### Methodology

The plugin allow to apply the methodology and main recommendations included (mainly) in these papers:
