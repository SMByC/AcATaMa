# Sampling Design

Selecting the sampling design is crucial and it could be based on the population/data type, what are you evaluating or your needs. At the moment we have implemented three main sampling design: simple random, stratified random, and systematic sampling and all are probability sampling designs. For example, use simple random for a population without strata. Stratified random is commonly employed for sampling within each stratum of the classes of stratified map. And systematic protocol to have some strata sampled systematically. But also we implemented post-stratify method for simple random and systematic sampling to ensure that samples randomly generated are only on specific strata ...

the response design includes procedures to collect information to determine the land cover and assigning one to each sampling unit
